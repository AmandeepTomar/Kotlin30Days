Its a simple project to combine all the learning that we have learned during the course time . 
Its really helpful to get the knowledge from the community. 
We tried to make a simple APP using some concepts that we have learned in few days, this project is showcase of my learning during **#30DaysOfKotlin conducted by Google developers India**.

## Technology slack

- DataBinding 
- ViewBinding
- Navigation Component 
- Room 
-  kotlin coroutines 
- Firebase Auth
- Build Type 

# Features
 this not an app basically its bundle of concepts and learning,  I have just created a conceptual repo that cover android MVVM architecture using Dagger2 with room , databindig and  kotlin coroutines . Here using  kotlin coroutines  with dagger2 and room is new learning for me. 
We phase many type of errors when we use all the things together specially Dagger2, Room and databiunding. 

# Build Type
Build type and variant is an exciting topic so as of now i just keep it simple and created two variant Demo and Prod. 

In future  will update more this.
